# FLOATING-PLATFORM
There is a partially constructed platform floating in space which is made of cubes. The
platform can be represented by 2D array with each element representing number of
cubes in respective position.

The way the platform is piled up, is given by an n x m matrix, where each element says
how many cubes are stacked upward in that position. You have to write a function for
calculating the quantity of water which will be stored in that construction if we pour
unlimited supply of water on top of it. Since the platform is suspended in space, if an
element has 0 as one of the elements, it will represent a drain. Use Numpy to solve the
problem.
